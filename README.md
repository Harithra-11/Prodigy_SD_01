Here's a Java program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program prompts the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement, then converts the temperature to the other two units and displays the converted values.The program prompts the user to input a temperature value and its unit of measurement.
Depending on the input unit, the program calls the appropriate conversion method.Each method converts the given temperature to the other two units and prints the results.
Basic Input and Output Operations:

-->Understanding how to read input from the user using the Scanner class.
Displaying formatted output to the console using System.out.printf.

-->Control Structures:
Using switch statements to handle different cases based on user input.
Applying conditional logic to determine which conversion method to call based on the input unit.

-->Method Creation and Usage:
Defining methods to encapsulate specific functionalities, promoting modularity and readability.
Calling methods and passing parameters to perform specific tasks.

-->Error Handling Basics:
Implementing basic error handling for invalid input units by providing a default case in the switch statement.
Code Readability and Formatting:

-->Basic Java Syntax and Concepts:

Reinforcing fundamental Java syntax, such as data types, variable declarations, and arithmetic operations.
Understanding the basic structure of a Java program, including the main method and method definitions.

By implementing this program, one gains practical experience with these core programming concepts, which are foundational for more advanced programming tasks and problem-solving in Java.
